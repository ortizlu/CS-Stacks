This is a simple example of how data structures "stacks" and "queues" work in Python as well as JS. These examples were created using the built-in classes known in both languages.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and Clone this directory
2. cd into directory
3. on your favorite python compiler run `python3 stacks.py` or `python3 queue.py` and for JS run `node stacks.js` or `node queue.js`
